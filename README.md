## Configuration

### App Settings

Key configuration files:
- `app.json`: Expo configuration, permissions, app metadata
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `tamagui.config.ts`: UI theme configuration

### Permissions

The app requires these permissions:
- **Location**: For current position and route planning
- **Internet**: For map tiles, routing, and weather data

These are automatically handled by Expo for development builds.

## API Services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location permissions denied**:
   - Enable location services in device settings
   - Grant permission when prompted by the app

2. **Map not loading**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Restart the app

3. **Weather data not showing**:
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if OpenWeatherMap API is accessible

4. **Route calculation fails**:
   - Ensure start and end points are valid
   - Check if OSRM service is accessible
   - Try different locations

### Performance Tips

- **Limit saved routes**: Keep under 50 routes for optimal performance
- **Clear old routes**: Regularly clean up unused saved routes
- **Restart app**: If experiencing memory issues
